                                       WHAT IS CAVERNS & CHAMELEONS?<br>
<br>
<br>
Caverns & Chameleons is a simplistic table top role playing game designed to be accessible to players inexperienced with convoluted gameplay mechanics and memorization while providing an open sandbox for Game Masters, or GM's, to create immersive stories for players to experience. By following along to the rules in this page, a party of players could reasonably run a champaign with no prior experience with role playing games.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the story is driven by verbal interaction between the player and the GM without the dictation of chance or dice rolls, but to calculate elements of chance, the game has an action system to determine whether characters may fail or succeed at tasks they wish to preform. Outside of those instances, the players are free to dictate where their character goes, what they say, who they talk to, and what they think. The object of the game is to work cooperatively to uncover a story or complete an objective laid out by the GM.<br>
<br>
Caverns & Chameleons has no overarching story or plot. There is no setting or cast of characters intrinsic to the game, and each group of players much work with their GM to create their own world they wish to play in. A lot of the elements in this guide give examples of weapons, spells, character classes and more that can be refered to for new players, but GM's are very much encouraged to sculpt the game as they see fit to best suite the story they wish to tell. The spirit of the game is far more about narrative than it is competition.<br>
<br>
Also, as a fair warning, this edition of Caverns & Chameleons was written in about a total of 12 hours tops loosely based on the first edition of a game by the same name. If you care about balancing, refine or disregard all the example sheets in this guide.<br>

____________________________<br>
<br>
[a] ABOUT ACTION POINTS <br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Action attempts require and consume action points. Each character as a maximum amount of action points they can store, as well as a maximum of actions they can preform each turn.<br>
Turns are only kept track of during Action Phases, which are combat or other time sensitive events.<br>
<br>
Action points only matter in non-time sensative environments when preforming an "action of considerable effort", which is usually anything that requires a roll for a phsycially based stat. Strength, Agility, and Endurance based rolls all typically consume an action point upon being resolved.<br>
An action being resolved does not mean the attempt succeeded, it just means the results the action are final and no longer subject to inteference.<br>
<br>
If a player is attempting an action but has no action points remaining to consume, they must make a fatigue save or 36 or higher on two D20s, adding their Endurance stat to their roll. On a successful fatigue save, they may attempt the action despite having no remaining action points. Fatigue saves do not let a player bypass the action limit of their turn however.<br>
<br>
One hour of resting will restore 10% of their max hitpoints and 10% of their max action points. (Both rounded to the nearest point)<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
[b] ATHLETIC FEATS<br>
____________________________<br>

For actions that involve making a phsyical attempt of prowress, the stats used are typically Agility and Strength. Every actions has a difficulty score determined by the GM. Difficulty scores are intended to repesent the chance of success that player has, with a 30 being 15%, 20 being 50%, 10 being 75%, ect. Most "narative" actions, like picking up a cup, will have a difficulty score of 0, so they require no roll, but take for example picking up a boulder, a GM may determine it has a difficulty score of 21, so a player would have to reach a sum of 21 or higher on their attempt to succeed. An action attempt is two D20 rolls added to base stat value. <br>
<br>
This whole process looks like: The player checks if they have an action point to use (either out of their sum or if it is within their turn limit) and decides to make an "action of considerable effort", lets say jumping a small canyon. The GM determines a difficulty score based on their understanding of the context, in our example a 30 for a moderately sized canyon indicating a 75% chance of success. The player rolls two D20, adds their agility, then if the sum is above a 30 they succeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
[c] COMBAT<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Combat is a type of action phase in which 2 or more characters are fighting eachother. Characters take turns fighting, and each character has a finite amount of action points they are allowed to expend in a single turn, shown on their character sheet. Action points are consumed by attacks, sometimes more than one per attack depending on the weapon, as well as through "actions of considerable effort". When all of a characters actions for their turn are depleted, the next character begins their turn. Turn order is determined by the highest to lowest Agility stat.<br>
<br>
The most common action duing combat, an attack, is an attempt to hit the other opponent with either a weapon or spell, the success being determined by if your hit roll is higher than the difficulty score of the spell or attack.<br>
Every weapon and spell has it's own difficulty score that determines the chances of hitting, and is not altered based on circumstance except for very rare exceptions. If it's a particularly odd attack, such as leaping off of a moving object and striking midair, the GM should treat the hit as an "action of considerable effort" rather than an attack attempt.
Players increase their chances of scoring a hit by adding their associated weapon or spell proficiency to each hit roll.<br> 
<br>
If a hit is successful, meaning the player met the difficulty score of the weapon, the victim still has a chance to avoid the damage with a save. A save does not consume any action points and can be done anytime the victim is conscious and able to move. The difficulty score of a save is the same as the difficulty score of the weapon or spell they are being hit with, plus the weapon proficiency modifier of the wielder of the weapon. The victim's Endurance stat is added towards their save roll. If the victim has a shield or something that may act as a shield, their Endurance stat is multiplied by 2 before being adaded towards their save roll.<br>
<br>
Example: A player with a polearms skill of 13 swings a pike with a difficulty score of 25 at a character. He must roll a 12 or higher to succeed. If he does, the attack hits and the victim gets a chance to save. They must roll a 38 or higher to take no damage, with their Endurance stat acting as a modifier to their roll. With an Endurance stat of 6, they would have to roll 32 or higher on two D20s to avoid all damage from this attack.<br> 
The victim can always opt not to make a save if they would not like to.<br>
<br>
If the attacker hits, and the victim fails their save. Damage is dealt, which is determined by the weapon and is usally indicated by a number of dice and the sides of the dice required. (ex: 1d6 damage)<br>
The damage dealt is substracted from the hitpoints of the victim, and if their hitpoints drop below zero, they lose consciousness and can only make mortality saves.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
[d] MORTALITY SAVES<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Before anything else, if the damage dealt to a character puts their hitpoints into a negative value that is greater than their max hitpoints, they die automatically without the chance to make a save.<br>
<br>
If they merely have hitpoints below zero, they have the chance to save themselves. On their turn, they may exchange an action point for a mortality save for as many action points as they can use that turn. A mortality save is a single D6 roll. On a roll of 6, your character regains consciousness and has their hitpoints set to 1. On a roll of 1, they take 10 damage to their hitpoints. Again, if their hitpoints reach the negative inverse of their max hitpoints, they die.<br>
<br>
A party member may revive you when the party is no longer in an action phase (combat or time sensative events). This does not have a chance of failing, but it still consumes an action point.<br>
<br>
To recover your hitpoints and avoid mortality, players consume healing items and rest. One hour of resting will restore 10% of their max hitpoints and 10% of their max action points. (Both rounded to the nearest point)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
[f] WEAPONS<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Weapons are sorted into 5 categories, and all characters have an associated preficiency for each one. A characters preficiency is added to their hit roll when using the cooresponding weapon type. The weapon types are as follows: <br>
<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
| One Handed : Short swords, one handed axes, hammers, rapiers, and many improvised weapons          |<br>
| Two Handed : Broadswords, longswords, battle axes and battle hammers                               |<br>
| Polearms   : Spears, pikes, halbards, staffs, and other long swingy things                         |<br>
| Mounted    : Gauntlets, arm mounted blades, leg mounted weapons                                    |<br>
| Ranged     : Bows, slings, slingshots, throwables                                                  |<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
<br>
Weapons do not have specific ranges, and combat does not have a definitive "field of play".<br>
As a general rule, the more damage a weapon can do, the harder it's difficulty score will be, many being entirely impossible to use without high proficiency.<br>
If you are the GM, your goal should be to keep players having weapons that have roughly a 75% or higher chance to hit, to keep them engaged in combat. If a player had a proficiency of 8 in a weapon type, you should aim to keep them using weapons with a difficulty score of around 18.<br>
<br>
Listed below is a very vague reference for what potential weapons could look like at various points in the game. Feel free to use this as a guide but know it is highly recommended to generate weapons for the players based on where they are specifically in progression. Always assume the character has at least some proficiency in the weapon they will be using (this includes making sure NPCs are sufficiently proficient) and try to adapt the weapons in the world to the needs and abilities of the players. A highly proficient player should have weapons impossible to use by an inexperienced one, and low difficulty weapons should always do less damage. Other than that, weapon creating is very open to creativity, so don't feel limited to this chart!<br>

[g] MAGIC SPELLS<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Unlike first edition, magical actions are not determined by players and checked by the GM, but rather have a list of spells with categories similar to weapons. Magic is also no longer a character stat, replaced instead by magical proficiencies, similar to weapon proficiencies, that each spell can be categorized into. They are as follows:<br>
<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
| Augmentation : Changing nonphysical aspects of the world around you, making lights, illusions, ect |<br>
| Restoration  : Healing hitpoints and action points of yourself and others, and even the dead       |<br>
| Destruction  : Create fireballs, bolts of lightning, hurricanes, and disruptions of earth          |<br>
| Conjuration  : Changing phsyical aspects of the world around you, summoning walls, weapons, ect    |<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
<br>
Some classes have higher proficiency in certain categories due to inherent abilities, so choosing a class compatible with a desired magic type can be important. Spells themselves are stored similarily to weapons on a character, with a list of spells associated with your character. However, just like a warrior can only carry so many weapons, each spell has it's own magical equivilent to weight and a character can only hold a finite amount at once, determined by their class and level. To switch out your spells, rest for one hour per spell you would like to add. It does not take any time resting to remove a spell.<br>
<br>
Many spells require more than one action points, which can be expensive but is usually not a problem outside of action phases. While in an action phase however, the number of action points a spell requires may be outside of your turn limit. Intrisically magical classes like mages have an ability that allows them to store action points from one turn to a next. This allows you to cast every spell while in combat, but will make expensive spells take much longer to cast in combat. <br>
Spells that last until a specific duration, like the end of a following turn for example, are depleted after sufficient usage or when the GM dictates.<br>

* Clarifications and Rulings *

All spells that deal damage can be have their damage saved by the victim, just like regular weapons.
Reveal Poison - "Poison" constitutes any maliciously added ingredient intended to be consumed.
Thunder - This deals damage regardless of the consciousness or life of the caster.
Mortal Trade - The target must be alive. Any character able to make mortality saves is a valid target.
Summon Weapon - You do not need an open weapon slot to use the temporary weapon summoned.
Spell Stasis - You must also successfully cast the spell you intend to preserve in addition to the cost of the stasis. You may only have as many spells queued as you have actions per turn 



____________________________

[h] CREATING A NEW CHARACTER
____________________________


All characters start at level zero with the base hitpoints, action points, and default proficiencies for their class. Each class has particular intrinsic abilities that are specific to their class and they cannot be removed. It's important to pick a class that will allow a character to develop with intentional strategy as the game progresses.

After you have finished copying hitpoints, action points, proficiencies, weapon capacity, and spell capicity from the class, you allot 15 proficiency points to destribute amongst any weapon or magic types you desire. These proficiencies will be increased as characters level up, but starting proficiencies can be important in the early game, so choose wisely.

Now you determine your base stats, meaning your Strength, Agility, Endurance, and Intelligence. You get 12 points to distribute as you please to each category. After you allocate them, choose one stat and add a D4 roll to it. You may only do this to one stat.
Next, select a weapon to add to equip to your first weapon slot. The weapon you choose MUST BE THE SAME WEAPON TYPE as the highest weapon proficiency of your character. For example, a character with a One Handed proficiency of 10 and a Mounted proficiency of 4 can only choose a One Handed weapon as their starter weapon. After this, add any items to the character's inventory that are congruent with the story being played. This includes any clothing, armour, money, or personal effects.

GMs should play an active role with helping players create characters. Caverns & Chameleons places heavy emphasis on the ability of GMs to create unique worlds without many overarching rules of the game interfering. As such, there is no defined currency, magical items, or finite set of abilities or skills. It is HEAVILY encouraged, to the utmost extent possible, that a GM designs weapons spells and items that fit the story they are telling. Players should be made aware of the setting they are playing in, and work with the facilitator to create a character that is both fun to play and using the elements of the world created.

Here is the list of classes with their default stats and abilities:




=========================================================================================================

Whenever you make an attack with a ranged weapon, you may opt not to roll the difficulty score and instead deal a singular point of damage.

You may spend an action point to reroll a one dice of a damage save against one attack. You may not use this ability more than once per attack. The consumed action point does not count against your actions per turn.
