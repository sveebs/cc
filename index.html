                                       WHAT IS CAVERNS & CHAMELEONS?<br>
<br>
<br>
Caverns & Chameleons is a simplistic table top role playing game designed to be accessible to players inexperienced <br>
with convoluted gameplay mechanics and memorization while providing an open sandbox for Game Masters, or GM's, to <br>
create immersive stories for players to experience. By following along to the rules in this page, a party of <br>
players could reasonably run a champaign with no prior experience with role playing games.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the story is driven by verbal interaction between the player and the GM without the dictation<br> 
of chance or dice rolls, but to calculate elements of chance, the game has an action system to determine whether<br>
characters may fail or succeed at tasks they wish to perform. Outside of those instances, the players are free <br>
to dictate where their character goes, what they say, who they talk to, and what they think. The object of the <br>
game is to work cooperatively to uncover a story or complete an objective laid out by the GM.<br>
<br>
Caverns & Chameleons has no overarching story or plot. There is no setting or cast of characters intrinsic to <br>
the game, and each group of players much work with their GM to create their own world they wish to play in. A lot<br>
of the elements in this guide give examples of weapons, spells, character classes and more that can be referred <br>
to for new players, but GM's are very much encouraged to sculpt the game as they see fit to best suite the story <br>
they wish to tell. The spirit of the game is far more about narrative than it is competition.<br>
<br>
Also, as a fair warning, this edition of Caverns & Chameleons was written in about a total of 12 hours tops <br>
loosely based on the first edition of a game by the same name. If you care about balancing, refine or disregard <br>
all the example sheets in this guide.<br>
<br>

____________________________<br>
<br>
[a] ABOUT ACTION POINTS <br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Action attempts require and consume action points. Each character as a maximum amount of action points they can<br>
store, as well as a maximum of actions they can perform each turn.<br>
Turns are only kept track of during Action Phases, which are combat or other time sensitive events.<br>
<br>
Action points only matter in non-time sensitive environments when preforming an "action of considerable <br>
effort", which is usually anything that requires a roll for a physically based stat. Strength, Agility, and <br>
Endurance based rolls all typically consume an action point upon being resolved.<br>
An action being resolved does not mean the attempt succeeded, it just means the results the action are final and <br>
no longer subject to interference.<br>
<br>
If a player is attempting an action but has no action points remaining to consume, they must make a fatigue save <br>
or 36 or higher on two D20s, adding their Endurance stat to their roll. On a successful fatigue save, they may <br>
attempt the action despite having no remaining action points. Fatigue saves do not let a player bypass the action <br>
limit of their turn however.<br>
<br>
One hour of resting will restore 10% of their max hitpoints and 10% of their max action points. (Both rounded to<br>
the nearest point)<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
[b] FEATS<br>
____________________________<br>

For actions that involve making a physical attempt of prowess, the stats used are typically Agility and Strength.<br>
For actions that involve cunning, conversation, perception, or crafting, the Intelligence Stat will be used. <br>
Every actions has a difficulty score determined by the GM. Difficulty scores are intended to represent the chance<br>
of success that player has, with a 30 being 15%, 20 being 50%, 10 being 75%, ect. Most "narrative" actions, like<br>
picking up a cup, will have a difficulty score of 0, so they require no roll, but take for example picking up a<br>
boulder, a GM may determine it has a difficulty score of 21, so a player would have to reach a sum of 21 or <br>
higher on their attempt to succeed. An action attempt is two D20 rolls added to base stat value. <br>
<br>
This whole process looks like: The player checks if they have an action point to use (either out of their sum <br>
or if it is within their turn limit) and decides to make an "action of considerable effort", lets say jumping<br>
a small canyon. The GM determines a difficulty score based on their understanding of the context, in our example<br>
a 30 for a narrow canyon indicating a 75% chance of success. The player rolls two D20, adds their<br>
agility, then if the sum is above a 30 they succeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
[c] COMBAT<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Combat is a type of action phase in which 2 or more characters are fighting eachother. Characters take turns <br>
fighting, and each character has a finite amount of action points they are allowed to expend in a single turn,<br>
shown on their character sheet. Action points are consumed by attacks, sometimes more than one per attack <br>
depending on the weapon, as well as through "actions of considerable effort". When all of a characterâ€™s actions <br>
for their turn are depleted, the next character begins their turn. Turn order is determined by the highest to <br>
lowest Agility stat.<br>
<br>
The most common action during combat, an attack, is an attempt to hit the other opponent with either a weapon or <br>
spell, the success being determined by if your hit roll is higher than the difficulty score of the spell or attack.<br>
Every weapon and spell has its own difficulty score that determines the chances of hitting, and is not altered <br>
based on circumstance except for very rare exceptions. If it's a particularly odd attack, such as leaping off of <br>
a moving object and striking midair, the GM should treat the hit as an "action of considerable effort" rather than <br>
an attack attempt.<br>
Players increase their chances of scoring a hit by adding their associated weapon or spell proficiency to each <br>
hit roll.<br> 
<br>
If a hit is successful, meaning the player met the difficulty score of the weapon, the victim still has a chance to <br>
avoid the damage with a save. A save does not consume any action points and can be done anytime the victim is <br>
conscious and able to move. The difficulty score of a save is the same as the difficulty score of the weapon or <br>
spell they are being hit with, plus the weapon proficiency modifier of the wielder of the weapon. The victim's <br>
Endurance stat is added towards their save roll. If the victim has a shield or something that may act as a shield, <br>
their Endurance stat is multiplied by 2 before being added towards their save roll.<br>
<br>
Example: A player with a polearms skill of 13 swings a pike with a difficulty score of 25 at a character. He must <br>
roll a 12 or higher to succeed. If he does, the attack hits and the victim gets a chance to save. They must roll a <br>
38 or higher to take no damage, with their Endurance stat acting as a modifier to their roll. With an Endurance <br>
stat of 6, they would have to roll 32 or higher on two D20s to avoid all damage from this attack.<br> 
The victim can always opt not to make a save if they would not like to.<br>
<br>
If the attacker hits, and the victim fails their save. Damage is dealt, which is determined by the weapon and is <br>
usually indicated by a number of dice and the sides of the dice required. (ex: 1d6 damage)<br>
The damage dealt is subtracted from the hitpoints of the victim, and if their hitpoints drop below zero, they lose <br>
consciousness and can only make mortality saves.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
[d] MORTALITY SAVES<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Before anything else, if the damage dealt to a character puts their hitpoints into a negative value that is greater <br>
than their max hitpoints, they die automatically without the chance to make a save.<br>
<br>
If they merely have hitpoints below zero, they have the chance to save themselves. On their turn, they may exchange <br>
an action point for a mortality save for as many action points as they can use that turn. A mortality save is a <br>
single D6 roll. On a roll of 6, your character regains consciousness and has their hitpoints set to 1. On a roll of 1,<br>
they take 10 damage to their hitpoints. Again, if their hitpoints reach the negative inverse of their max hitpoints, they die.<br>
<br>
A party member may revive you when the party is no longer in an action phase (combat or time sensitive events). This does <br>
not have a chance of failing, but it still consumes an action point.<br>
<br>
To recover your hitpoints and avoid mortality, players consume healing items and rest. One hour of resting will restore 10%<br>
of their max hitpoints and 10% of their max action points. (Both rounded to the nearest point)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
[f] WEAPONS<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Weapons are sorted into 5 categories, and all characters have an associated proficiency for each one. A characters <br>
proficiency is added to their hit roll when using the corresponding weapon type. The weapon types are as follows: <br>
<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
| One Handed : Short swords, one handed axes, hammers, rapiers, and many improvised weapons          |<br>
| Two Handed : Broadswords, longswords, battle axes and battle hammers                               |<br>
| Polearms   : Spears, pikes, halbards, staffs, and other long swingy things                         |<br>
| Mounted    : Gauntlets, arm mounted blades, leg mounted weapons                                    |<br>
| Ranged     : Bows, slings, slingshots, throwables                                                  |<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
<br>
Weapons do not have specific ranges, and combat does not have a definitive "field of play".<br>
As a general rule, the more damage a weapon can do, the harder it's difficulty score will be, many being entirely <br>
impossible to use without high proficiency.<br>
If you are the GM, your goal should be to keep players having weapons that have roughly a 75% or higher chance to hit,<br>
to keep them engaged in combat. If a player had a proficiency of 8 in a weapon type, you should aim to keep them using <br>
weapons with a difficulty score of around 18.<br>
<br>
Listed below is a very vague reference for what potential weapons could look like at various points in the game. Feel free <br>
to use this as a guide but know it is highly recommended to generate weapons for the players based on where they are <br>
specifically in progression. Always assume the character has at least some proficiency in the weapon they will be using <br>
(this includes making sure NPCs are sufficiently proficient) and try to adapt the weapons in the world to the needs and <br>
abilities of the players. A highly proficient player should have weapons impossible to use by an inexperienced one, and <br>
low difficulty weapons should always do less damage. Other than that, weapon creating is very open to creativity, so don't <br>
feel limited to this chart!<br>

[g] MAGIC SPELLS<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Unlike first edition, magical actions are not determined by players and checked by the GM, but rather have a list <br>
of spells with categories similar to weapons. Magic is also no longer a character stat, replaced instead by magical <br>
proficiencies, similar to weapon proficiencies, that each spell can be categorized into. They are as follows:<br>
<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
| Augmentation : Changing nonphysical aspects of the world around you, making lights, illusions, ect |<br>
| Restoration  : Healing hitpoints and action points of yourself and others, and even the dead       |<br>
| Destruction  : Create fireballs, bolts of lightning, hurricanes, and disruptions of earth          |<br>
| Conjuration  : Changing physical aspects of the world around you, summoning walls, weapons, ect    |<br>
x----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x<br>
<br>
Some classes have higher proficiency in certain categories due to inherent abilities, so choosing a class compatible <br>
with a desired magic type can be important. Spells themselves are stored similarly to weapons on a character, with a <br>
list of spells <br>
associated with your character. However, just like a warrior can only carry so many weapons, each spell has it's own <br>
magical <br>
equivalent to weight and a character can only hold a finite amount at once, determined by their class and level. <br>
To switch out your spells, rest for one hour per spell you would like to add. It does not take any time resting to <br>
remove a spell.<br>
Many spells require more than one action points, which can be expensive but is usually not a problem outside of action <br>
phases. <br>
While in an action phase however, the number of action points a spell requires may be outside of your turn limit. <br>
Intrinsically magical classes like mages have an ability that allows them to store action points from one turn to a <br>
next. This allows you to cast every spell while in combat, but will make expensive spells take much longer to cast <br>
in combat. <br>
<br>
Spells that last until a specific duration, like the end of a following turn for example, are depleted after sufficient <br>
usage or when the GM dictates.<br>

* Clarifications and Rulings *<br>
<br>
All spells that deal damage can be have their damage saved by the victim, just like regular weapons.<br>
Reveal Poison - "Poison" constitutes any maliciously added ingredient intended to be consumed.<br>
Thunder - This deals damage regardless of the consciousness or life of the caster.<br>
Mortal Trade - The target must be alive. Any character able to make mortality saves is a valid target.<br>
Summon Weapon - You do not need an open weapon slot to use the temporary weapon summoned.<br>
Spell Stasis - You must also successfully cast the spell you intend to preserve in addition to the cost of the stasis. <br>
You may only have as many spells queued as you have actions per turn.<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
[h] CREATING A NEW CHARACTER<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
All characters start at level zero with the base hitpoints, action points, and default proficiencies for their class. <br>
Each class has particular intrinsic abilities that are specific to their class and they cannot be removed. It's important <br>
to pick a class that will allow a character to develop with intentional strategy as the game progresses.<br>
<br>
After you have finished copying hitpoints, action points, proficiencies, weapon capacity, and spell capacity from the class,<br>
you allot 15 proficiency points to distribute amongst any weapon or magic types you desire. These proficiencies will be <br>
increased as characters level up, but starting proficiencies can be important in the early game, so choose wisely.<br>
<br>
Now you determine your base stats, meaning your Strength, Agility, Endurance, and Intelligence. You get 12 points to distribute <br>
as you please to each category. After you allocate them, choose one stat and add a D4 roll to it. You may only do this to one<br>
stat. Next, select a weapon to add to equip to your first weapon slot. The weapon you choose MUST BE THE SAME WEAPON TYPE as <br>
the highest weapon proficiency of your character. For example, a character with a One Handed proficiency of 10 and a Mounted <br>
proficiency of 4 can only choose a One Handed weapon as their starter weapon. After this, add any items to the character's <br>
inventory that are congruent <with the story being played. This includes any clothing, armour, money, or personal effects.<br>
<br>
GMs should play an active role with helping players create characters. Caverns & Chameleons places heavy emphasis on the ability of <br>
GMs to create unique worlds without many overarching rules of the game interfering. As such, there is no defined currency, magical <br>
items, or finite set of abilities or skills. It is HEAVILY encouraged, to the utmost extent possible, that a GM designs weapons spells <br>
and items that fit the story they are telling. Players should be made aware of the setting they are playing in, and work with the <br>
facilitator to create a character that is both fun to play and using the elements of the world created.<br>

Whenever you make an attack with a ranged weapon, you may opt not to roll the difficulty score and instead deal <br>
a singular point of damage.<br>
